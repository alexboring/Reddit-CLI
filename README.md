Reddit-CLI

A program to scrape reddit and navigate through it with the CLI.

Though it's buggy, it solves a lot of challenges presented by the reddit JSON structure, such as self-referential comment tables for child/parent relationships. 

Coded for Flatiron Module 1 Final project with Alex Boring (https://github.com/alexboring)
